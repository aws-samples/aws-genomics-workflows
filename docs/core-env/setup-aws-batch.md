# AWS Batch for Genomics Workflows

## What is AWS Batch?

[AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) is a managed service that helps you efficiently run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Users submit jobs to job queues, specifying the application to be run and the compute resources (CPU and memory) required by the job. AWS Batch is responsible for launching the appropriate quantity and types of instances needed to run your jobs.

AWS Batch manages the following resources:

* Job Definitions
* Job Queues
* Compute Environments

A [job definition](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_definitions.html) specifies how jobs are to be run. For example, which Docker image to use for your job, how many vCPUs and how much memory is required, the IAM role to be used, and more.

Jobs are submitted to [job queues](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_queues.html) where they reside until they can be scheduled to run on Amazon EC2 instances within a compute environment. An AWS account can have multiple job queues, each with varying priority. This gives you the ability to closely align the consumption of compute resources with your organizational requirements.

[Compute environments](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) provision and manage your EC2 instances and other compute resources that are used to run your AWS Batch jobs. Job queues are mapped to one or more compute environments and a given environment can also be mapped to one or more job queues. This many-to-many relationship is defined by the compute environment order and job queue priority properties.

The following diagram shows a general overview of how the AWS Batch resources interact.

## AWS Batch Jobs Requirements

AWS Batch does not make assumptions on the structure and requirements that Jobs take with respect to inputs and outputs. Batch Jobs may take data streams, files, or only parameters as input, and produce the same variety for output, inclusive of files, metadata changes, updates to databases, etc. Batch assumes that each application handles their own input/output requirements.

A common pattern for bioinformatics tooling is that files such as genomic sequence data are both inputs and outputs to/from a process. Many bioinformatics tools have also been developed to run in traditional Linux-based compute clusters with shared filesystems and are not necessarily optimized for cloud computing.

The set of common requirements for genomics on AWS Batch are:

* Independent execution:

    To make your workflow as flexible as possible, each job should run independently. As a result, you cannot necessarily guarantee that different jobs in the same overall workflow run on the same instance. Using S3 as the location to exchange data between containers enables you to decouple storage of your intermediate files from compute.

* Multitenancy:

    Multiple container jobs may run concurrently on the same instance. In these situations, it is essential that your job writes to a unique subdirectory.

* Data cleanup:

    As your jobs complete and write the output back to S3, it is a good idea to delete the scratch data generated by that job on your instance. This allows you to optimize for cost by reusing EC2 instances if there are jobs remaining in the queue, rather than terminating the EC2 instances.

## AWS Batch Environment

A complete AWS Batch environment consists of the following:

1. A Compute Environment that utilizes [EC2 Spot instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html) for cost-effective computing
2. A Compute Environment that utilizes EC2 on-demand (e.g. [public pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)) instances for high-priority work that can't risk job interruptions or delays due to insufficient Spot capacity.
3. A default Job Queue that utilizes the Spot compute environment first, but falls back to the on-demand compute environment if there is spare capacity available.
4. A high-priority Job Queue that leverages the on-demand and Spot CE's (in that order) and has higher priority than the default queue.

The CloudFormation template below will create all of the above.
